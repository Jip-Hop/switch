Switch for linux
http://www.magiclantern.fm/forum/index.php?topic=15108.msg146822#msg146822

In order for Switch to work follow these steps:

1 - Move the folder named "Switch" to your home directory. All paths will point to this folder.
2 - Right click the desktop file named "Switch" choose "properties" then "Permissions". On "Execute" select "Allow executing file as a program"
3 - Done. You can place your desktop file wherever and double click to get started.

Good to know. 
Switch will ask that you installs YAD. A program that is needed for Switch to be able to select folders. Simply follow instructions when asked to install. 

If you are working with darkframes/flatframes Switch will ask to install imagemagick. Simply follow instructions when asked to install.
