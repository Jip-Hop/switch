About

MlRawViewer is a cross-platform viewer for raw video files produced by the Magic Lantern add-on software for Canon DSLR cameras. (See http://www.magiclantern.fm/ for more details).

It supports both the original RAW format, and the newer MLV (RAW v2.0) format in both single and multi-file versions. It can also play CinemaDNG file sets.

It can act as a front end to ffmpeg for encoding raw files into another video format such as ProRes.

The program is written in python, and makes use of OpenGL for image processing in order to be able to display videos at their intended frame rate. This also depends on you having good file read speed in your computer.

It has mainly been developed and tested on Linux, but it has also been packaged for Mac and Windows.
